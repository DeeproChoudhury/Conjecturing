(* ### Problem


Find the minimum value of $\frac{9x^2\sin^2 x + 4}{x\sin x}$ for $0 < x < \pi$. 
Show that it is 12.

### Solution


Let $y = x \sin x$. It suffices to show that $12 \leq \frac{9y^2 + 4}{y}.

It is trivial to see that $y > 0$. 
Then one can multiply both sides by $y$ and 
it suffices to show $12y \leq 9y^2 + 4$.
This can be done by the sum of squares method.

(*### Problem

Show that for any complex number a, $(a-10)(a+11) = a^2 + a - 110$.


### Solution

We first expand all terms of the left hand side to get $a^2 - 10a + 11a - 10*11$.
This equals $a^2 + a - 10*11 = a^2 + a - 110$.

(*### Problem

For a positive real number x, show that $2 - \sqrt{2} \geq 2 - x - \frac{1}{2x}$.

### Solution

First notice that $2x$ is positive.
It suffices to show $\sqrt{2} \leq x + frac{1}{2x}$.
Let $y = \sqrt{2}$. $y*y = 2$.
Then $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \sqrt{2} = y*y * x*x + 1 - 2xy = (xy - 1)^2 \geq 0$.
Also notice that $2x*x + 1 - 2x * \sqrt{2} = 2x * (x + \frac{1}{2x} - \sqrt{2})$.
Therefore $x + \frac{1}{2x} - \sqrt{2} \geq 0$, given $2x > 0$.
Rearranging terms, we see that the required inequality holds.

### Problem

Let $x$ be a real number. Show that $x^2 + 2x + 1 \geq 0$.

### Solution

The expression can be factored as $(x + 1)^2$. The square of a real number is always non-negative, so $(x + 1)^2 \geq 0$.
