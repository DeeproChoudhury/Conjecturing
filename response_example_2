(* Problem:

Let x be a real number. Show that if x > 2 then x^2 > 4.

Solution:

Since x > 2, we can multiply both sides by x (which is positive since x > 2) to get x^2 > 2x. Since 2x > 4 (because x > 2), we have x^2 > 4.

Conjectures:
{'initial_conjecture': 'x_1 > 2', 'final_conjecture': 'x_1^2 > 4'}
